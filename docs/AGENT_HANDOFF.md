# NetSec Atlas Agent Handoff

## Read in this order

1. `ROADMAP.md`
2. `CHANGELOG.md`
3. `docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
4. `docs/content-audit/phase3-content-audit.md`
5. `docs/content-audit/phase3-first-100-roadmap.md`

## Current handoff

- Completed: Phases 0, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3.
- Next: Phase 4A only — bilingual routing architecture. Phase 4 is high risk and must be batched.
- Branch/workflow: `main`; use fast-forward pull, focused commits, normal push, never force-push.
- Production domain: `https://netsecatlas.com`.
- Legacy redirect domain: `technical-insights.com`.
- Baseline: typecheck/build pass; sitemap 235; RSS 50; main JS ~677.88 kB; articles chunk ~974.30 kB.

## Validation

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm --filter @workspace/techpulse-ar run build
```

Do not assume `pnpm run validate` exists. Run phase-specific checks explicitly.

## Operational rules

- Preserve the React/Vite/TypeScript and content-generation architecture.
- Do not edit `public/sitemap.xml`, `public/rss.xml`, `src/content/articles-index.json`, or `dist/` manually; update their source and regenerate.
- Do not delete/rewrite legacy content without the Phase 3 audit and owner-approved SEO/redirect decision.
- Explicit article metadata overrides inference; absence falls back to `src/lib/contentDiscovery.ts`.
- Do not fabricate vendor commands, configurations, scores, specifications, references, or SEO metrics.
- Known debt: oversized main/articles chunks; legacy README deployment/brand text; consumer content; 74 potentially thin items requiring human review; limited coverage for F5, BeyondTrust, Broadcom, Trellix, Infoblox, and VMware.

## Credit / Session Continuity Policy

Exact credits may not be exposed. Never invent a value. Split large phases into buildable batches, commit and push each completed batch, update this handoff before exhaustion, keep no critical work only in ephemeral storage, and verify the remote SHA before reporting completion.

For every phase, follow `docs/PHASE_CHECKLIST.md` and update ROADMAP, CHANGELOG, and this handoff when state changes.
